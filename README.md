White Thunder Jekyll Template
================

A simple (not so) white template for Jekyll. This template was made in order to study some front-end technologies and tools like:

- Sass
- Grunt.js
- Bower

I made this for my personal website (http://www.diogodmoreira.com). I made some changes in it that possibly cant be reflected here. Feel free to use this template and to start and issue.
